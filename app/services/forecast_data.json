This moisture-laden system will deliver 40-70 mm of rain by Thursday morning. Embedded thunderstorms will bring additional localized amounts and rainfall rates of up to 20-30 mm/hr tonight.\n\nRainfall rates will lessen on Thursday but persistent moist, onshore flow will cause showers, heavy at times, to continue Thursday. The heaviest rain amounts are expected near the mountains and eastern sections of the Fraser Valley.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Periods of rain, heavy at times, will continue through Saturday. Embedded thunderstorms and gusty winds are possible.\n\nThis sudden change to a prolonged wet pattern combined with local gusty winds and trees shedding their leaves may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nLate this week the pattern is intensified once again by a strong low pressure system crossing Vancouver Island Thursday night or Friday. Strong winds, and where they materialize, will depend on the exact storm track. Stay tuned to your local forecast throughout the week as we follow the evolution of this feature.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
